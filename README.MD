Tektronix DPO4000
========================================

Interfaced via TCP socket.
Note: setting IP address will fail with "Invalid device IP address" unless a network cable is connected!
"Socket Server" should be enabled, using port 4000.
Device should now respond to 'ping', show web page on http:// port 80, and be accessible via 'telnet' on port 4000.

Implemented via simple 'stream' device protocol,
some subroutine records to scale waveforms.

Example commands to type:
 *IDN?
